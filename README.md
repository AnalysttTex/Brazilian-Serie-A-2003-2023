Hello! Tex Here!
This is my 2nd ever professional project and one that is certainly going into my portfolio because it is kind of special to me.
As a football (soccer) fan, seeing various analysts use and apply data to their football knowledge has always been fascinating to me.
This dataset carries information about the brazilian serie a from the 2002/03 season up till 2022/23.
It encompasses results of each matches played, the teams involved and the venue/stadium
These basic information were decimated to retrieve information about different clubs and the trend of some football metrics as the seasons went by
